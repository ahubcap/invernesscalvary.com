            <h3>On Christmas Eve</h3>
            <p><b>Come celebrate the holiday this Christmas Eve at the Historic Courthouse!</b></p>
            <p>At 6:30pm, hot cocoa and sugar cookies will be given out, setting the atmosphere for a great night of celebration. Bring blankets and chairs, join us downtown, and get to know some of your neighbors. At 7:00 our community will join together singing fun holiday songs. Later on, we will celebrate the birth of Christ through the singing of traditional carols, and a story that ties the Nativity from past to present. The evening will end with a community candlelight service, filling the night with the light and joy that comes with the season.</p>
            <p><i>Parking will be available at any of the downtown lots.</i></p>
