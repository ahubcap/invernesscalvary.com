					<h1>GET INVOLVED</h1>
					<p>
					No matter where we are in our spiritual journey, we can always grow closer to God and His plan for our life.
                                        We want to see every person saved, healed, empowered, and launched into their calling.
                                        We believe there are elements of God's plan that can only be experienced within a church body.
                                        God designed us to be together.
                                        When we gather together we can grow together and as we grow together we are able to experience all that God has planned for His church.
                                        If you're searching for a church to call home, there is room for you to grow together with us.
                                        </p>
					<p>We have ministries, groups and programs designed for everyone in our church family to get plugged in to. Please <a href="/ministries/">click here</a> to learn more.</p>
					<p>If you have <a href="/contact/#general">questions, comments or concerns</a> we would love to help.</p>

						<h2>Come Worship with Us</h2>
						<p>
							At Calvary, our worship is in response to God's presence in our lives.
                                                        Sunday morning worship is designed to lift your spirit and prepare you to hear God's voice.
                                                        We believe in giving our all to God and our worship allows us to do that.
                                                        Driven by our relevant, and inspiring worship team, you will have a personal worship experience each Sunday.
						</p>
						<p>We suggest showing up 15 minutes prior to each service to get settled in without feeling rushed.</p>

						<h2>Become a Member</h2>
						<p>
						We invite you to <a href="/contact/#join">become a member</a> of our church family. Our class is designed for individuals who recently accepted Jesus as their Savior and for those who
						are recommitting their lives to living for Christ. Within our two-hour class, you will learn about our church family, beliefs, purpose, structure and vision.
						We will jump-start your spiritual growth by developing habits to help you become more like Jesus. We will discuss how God wants to use your spiritual gifts,
						heart, abilities, personality and experiences to minister to the needs of others.
						</p>
						<p>We strongly believe in your personal growth in life, and <a href="/contact/#join">becoming a member</a> of our family is a great step. We will be honored to be a part of this step in your walk.</p>

						<h2>Join a Ministry</h2>
						<p>
							Life Groups consists of small groups of people who meet weekly to discuss the current sermon series, grow spiritually and have fun together. These groups are
							the primary way of getting connected and growing in your faith &mdash; no matter what age you are, what season in your life you are in or what you need &mdash;
							we have a Life Group for you.

						<h2>Get Baptized</h2>
						<p>
						Once you surrender your life to Jesus Christ, the next step in your walk with Christ is to be baptized. Being baptized is a way to publicly proclaim your new
						life as a Christian. This practice that Jesus demonstrated symbolizes the burial of your old life and the resurrection of your new life. It is a powerful experience
						that you will bookmark in your new life. We encourage you to invite your friends and family to <a href="/contact/#join">join us</a> in celebrating the next step in your journey.
						</p>
						<p>We will be honored to be a part of this step in your walk, <a href="/contact/#baptized">sign up</a> today.</p>

						<h2>Donate to Calvary</h2>
						<div title="hide" style="display:none;" <p>
						The topic of finances and money is one of the most mentioned topics within the Bible. The overall message from the Bible about money advises against being too attached
						to it and points out that wealth can be fleeting. The Bible encourages trusting in God to provide rather than trying to build up and hoard large amounts of wealth.
						</p>
						<p>
						Here at Calvary Church, we offer the convenience and security of electronic, tax-deductible giving. Follow the instructions below to give a one-time gift or
						to set up regular recurring contributions to be automatically drafted from your checking account. You may set up a draft to contribute weekly, bi-monthly or in any manner
						you desire. This method is safe, consistent and you won’t have to worry about writing a check each week or mailing an offering in when you are away. You can use this online
						giving method to tithe or to give an offering to Missions, youth and other areas in the church.
						</p>
						<h3>Why Give?</h3>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>Tithing is worship &mdash; It is one of the best ways to tell God, "You are in charge", and to proclaim that to Him. It is faith in action.</li>
							<li>You will be advancing God's Kingdom &mdash; Our giving literally impacts the lives of thousands of people around the world because of our missions and outreach ministries.</li>
							<li>You will be building the church &mdash; Giving to our church isn't so our pastors can go on vacation, it all goes into expanding services, improving the building and allowing more people in our community to experience the good news from the Lord.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Why Give Online?</h3>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>You are taking a step of faith &mdash; When you sign up to give electronically you are deciding in advance to faithfully give. God loves a cheerful and faithful giver and He blesses that kind of faith.</li>
							<li>You will simplify your life &mdash; You won't have to remember whether you gave this month or need to send in an offering by mail when you are away on a trip.</li>
						</ul>
