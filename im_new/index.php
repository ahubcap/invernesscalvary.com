					Thank you so much for visiting Calvary Church. Please feel free to explore our site and learn about our church, pastors,
					groups and many other activities and programs designed to help our community and enlighten the wonderful people within it.

						<h2>What's Calvary All About?</h2>
						<h3>"Together, extravagantly love Jesus and, together, extravagantly love people."</h3>
						<p>
						We are passionate about the love of Jesus. Our focus is to reach the lost, rebuild relationships, encourage the community and grow families through
						relevant Bible teachings, exciting worship and family-based programs. Jesus died for our sins so we don't have to live with who we are and what we have done.
						Through the life of Jesus Christ and the love of our heavenly Father, we strive to create a safe place to come and worship Him.
						</p>
						<p>
						We love our church. We love the people that fill our church. We want to help and grow the wonderful people in our community. We are not here to judge people,
						but to love them through the different seasons of their life. We believe God has a plan and a purpose for everyone’s life and we believe in caring, loving and
						nurturing people through their journey. God is extravagantly for you and so are we.
						</p>

						<h2>What Can I Expect?</h2>

						Joining us on Sundays is always an amazing experience. We have a fun, relaxed, inviting atmosphere that focuses on building lasting

						we would love to see you join us.
						</p>
						<p>

						<h2>What Can My Kids Expect?</h2>
						<p>
						We love children of all ages. Our nurseries and preschool rooms are safe environments staffed with loving care and led in age-appropriate activities.
						We provide Christ-centered experiences for elementary-age children, which includes interactive worship and creative Bible teaching in a fun atmosphere.
						Junior High and High School students can join us on Wednesday night which is dedicated just for them. We believe in building the foundation
						for each age group so as they grow, so will their relationship with God.
