					<h1>MINISTRIES TO SERVE</h1>
					<p>
					Each volunteer plays an important role in fulfilling our Church's mission, which is helping those far from God to become extravagant followers of Jesus.
					Our goal is to help you find a team that fits your unique talents and gifts so you can serve with extreme joy and impact others in a significant way.
					There is no experience required because "on-the-job" training will be provided to all team members.
					</p>
<!-- 					<p>Check out all of our <a href="/ministries/for_adults/">ministries</a> which you can serve.</p> -->

						<p>Every Home for Christ is a local door-to-door outreach program designed to spread the good news of the Gospel to our neighbors in our community. We send teams

						<p>Every day we go, we come back amazed and changed from the experience. We would like to share with you some of the incredible stories we have from serving our community.</p>

						<h2>Food Pantry</h2>
						<p>People in our community are facing very difficult financial circumstances and many are unable to provide for the needs of their families. Here at Calvary Church,
						we desire to help these families in our own community. Our mission is about sharing the peace of Jesus Christ in all its dimensions. This is a great opportunity to show the love
						of Christ and be the church He has called us to be.</p>
						<h3>The Food Pantry is open on Thursday from 10am-12pm.</h3>
