					<h1>MINISTRIES FOR TEENS</h1>
					<p>
						One of our core values at Calvary is ministry to the entire family.
                                                Our goal is to provide opportunities for students to build a firm foundation in Christ as they navigate their teenage years.
                                                We intentionally invest in their lives now so that they will live with a Biblical worldview as adults.
                                                Our safe and fun atmospheres allow students to open up and experience the abundant life of Jesus Christ.

						<h2>The Well</h2>
						<p>More than a ministry…it’s a movement!</p>
						<p>
							God has given us a mandate to inspire and direct a generation into a burning relationship with God through Christ.  As a result of the fire that
							burns in the hearts of young people, an awakening will occur that will change our families, schools, churches and ultimately our nation.
						</p>

						<p>
							The Well is an active and exciting experience that your student does not want to miss. The Well urges your students in 6th-12th grades to join us for incredible,
							life-changing and sometimes wild services. We use relatable topics, youthful illustrations and exciting worship to grow and build the next generation of Christ followers.

						<h2>The Well Small Groups</h2>
						<p>
							Our student small groups follow the same semester schedule as our adult Life Groups.
                                                        There are unique groups for middle school boys, middle school girls, and high school students.
                                                        Small groups are the place where we encourage our young people to build meaningful relationships as they continue to grow in their faith in God.
                                                        Please check with our youth office for the time and location that works best for you and your student.
