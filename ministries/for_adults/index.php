						<h2>Missions</h2>
						<p>After Christ's death and resurrection, he commanded the disciples to share the Gospel and the message of His redemption. This Great Commission still
						applies to Christians everywhere today. In the book of Acts, the apostle Paul writes that Christians everywhere have a mission of reconciliation and
						that once we receive the power of the Holy Spirit, we should be His witness to the whole world.</p>

						<p>Christ didn't just want us to sit on our couch, He wanted us to spread the great news of His grace and righteousness. We believe in this, in fact,
						it won't take you long to find out Calvary Church has a strong heart for world missions. We deploy teams yearly to help teach the gospel and
						plant churches. Below you can learn about some of the missionaries that we support through our church.</p>

                                                    Prayer at Calvary Church is not something we <em>do</em>; it defines who we <em>are</em>.

                                                    Through prayer, we grow in our personal relationship with God.
                                                    Through intercession, we partner with God to establish His heart, His will, and His purposes in our familes, our church, our city, our nation, and the world.
                                                    Prayer is engaging, exciting, and rewarding.
